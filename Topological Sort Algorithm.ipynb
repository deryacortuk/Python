    "# Topological Sort Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "# Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge uv,\n",
    "# vertex u comes before v in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "# TopoloTopological sort is an algorithm that takes a directed acyclic graph and returns the sequence of nodes where \n",
    "# every node will appear before other nodes that it points to. \n",
    "# A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is the graph having directed edges from one node to another\n",
    "# but does not contain any directed cycle. Remember topological sorting for graphs is not applicable \n",
    "# if the graph is not a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The ordering of the nodes in the array is called topological ordering. \n",
    "# Therefore we can say that a topological sort of the nodes of a directed acyclic graph is the operation of arranging \n",
    "# the nodes in the order in such a way that if there exists an edge (i,j), i precedes j in the lists.\n",
    "# A topological sort basically gives a sequence in which we should perform the job and helps us to check\n",
    "# whether the graph consists of the cycle or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The running time complexity of the topological sorting algorithm is O(M + N) where the M is the number of edges \n",
    "# in the graph and N is the number of nodes in the graph. \n",
    "# The space complexity for the algorithm will be O(N) where N is the total number of nodes in the graph to allocate \n",
    "# the nodes in the result array.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Applications \n",
    "# Topological sort can be used to quickly find the shortest paths from the weighted directed acyclic graph.\n",
    "# It is used to check whether there exists a cycle in the graph or not\n",
    "# Topological sort is useful to find the deadlock condition in an operating system\n",
    "# It is used in course scheduling problems to schedule jobs\n",
    "# It is used to find the dependency resolution\n",
    "# Topological sort is very useful to find sentence ordering in very fewer efforts\n",
    "# It is used in manufacturing workflows or data serialization in an application\n",
    "# It is used for ordering the cell evaluation while recomputing formula values in an excel sheet or spreadsheet."
