    "# Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to find the shortest path from the source vertex to every vertex in a weighted graph.\n",
    "# Unlike Dijkstra's algorithm, the bellman ford algorithm can also find the shortest distance to every vertex in the weighted \n",
    "# graph even with the negative edges. The only difference between the Dijkstra algorithm and the bellman ford algorithm is that\n",
    "# Dijkstra's algorithm just visits the neighbour vertex in each iteration but the bellman ford algorithm visits each vertex \n",
    "# through each edge in every iteration.\n",
    "# As with Dijkstra’s algorithm, the Bellman-Ford algorithm is one of the SSSP (Single Source Shortest Path) algorithms.\n",
    "# Apart from Bellman-Ford Algorithm and Dijkstra's Algorithm, Floyd Warshall Algorithm is also the shortest path algorithm. \n",
    "# But Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to compute the shortest path from the single source vertex to all other vertices\n",
    "# whereas Floyd-Warshall algorithms compute the shortest path from each node to every other node.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bellman ford algorithm follows the dynamic programming approach by overestimating the length of the path from the starting \n",
    "# vertex to all other vertices. And then it starts relaxing the estimates by discovering the new paths which are shorter than\n",
    "# the previous ones. This process is followed by all the vertices for N-1 times for finding the optimized result. \n",
    "\n",
    "# The main advantage of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is its capability to handle negative weights. \n",
    "# However, the Bellman-Ford algorithm has a considerably larger complexity than Dijkstra’s algorithm.\n",
    "# Therefore,Dijkstra’s algorithm has more applications, because graphs with negative weights are usually considered a rare case.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Bellman-Ford algorithm can handle directed and undirected graphs with non-negative weights.\n",
    "# However, it can only handle directed graphs with negative weights, as long as we don’t have negative cycles.\n",

    "# We can use the Bellman-Ford algorithm to check the existence of negative cycles.\n",

    "# Best Case Complexity\tO(E)\n",

    "\n",
    "# Bellman-Ford’s algorithm is based on the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "# We will receive a weighted graph and an initial source node.\n",
    "# We need to traverse each node. Thus, we will visit each edge and try to reduce the path length of each seperate node.\n",
    "# This process is repeated V times because it may take V iterations to find the shortest path length.\n",
    "# Repeat this process until all the destination vertices have been assigned their path lengths."
