    "# Insertion Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration.\n",
    "# The first element in the array is assumed to be sorted. Take the second element and store it separately in key.\n",
    "# More efficient in practice than most other simple quadratic (i.e., O(n2)) algorithms such as selection sort or bubble sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Time Complexities\n",
    "\n",
    "# Worst Case Complexity: O(n2)\n",
    "# Suppose, an array is in ascending order, and you want to sort it in descending order. \n",
    "# In this case, worst case complexity occurs.\n",
    "# Each element has to be compared with each of the other elements so, for every nth element, \n",
    "# (n-1) number of comparisons are made.\n",
    "# Thus, the total number of comparisons = n*(n-1) ~ n2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Best Case Complexity: O(n)\n",
    "# When the array is already sorted, the outer loop runs for n number of times whereas the inner \n",
    "# loop does not run at all. So, there are only n number of comparisons. Thus, complexity is linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Average Case Complexity: O(n2)\n",
    "# It occurs when the elements of an array are in jumbled order (neither ascending nor descending).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Space Complexity\n",
    "# Space complexity is O(1) because an extra variable key is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insertion Sort Applications\n",
    "# the array is has a small number of elements\n",
    "# there are only a few elements left to be sorted\n",

    "# Algorithm \n",
    "# To sort an array of size n in ascending order: \n",
    "# Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array. \n",
    "# Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor. \n",
