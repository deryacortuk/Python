    "# The Heap Sort Algorithm focuses mostly on the creation of what we call a “max heap”. What is a “heap”? \n",
    "# A heap is a special tree based data structures, with nodes that have children nodes. \n",
    "# The first element in the heap, is known as the root node. The children of each node are smaller (in value) than the node\n",
    "# itself. \n",
    "# The Heap Sort Algorithm in Python, is divided amongst two functions. One of them is responsible for creating the heap,\n",
    "# and the other is responsible for the swapping of elements within the heap to build a max heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "# A complete binary tree has an interesting property that we can use to find the children and parents of any node.\n",
    "# If the index of any element in the array is i, the element in the index 2i+1 will become the left child and element in 2i+2 \n",
    "# index will become the right child. Also, the parent of any element at index i is given by the lower bound of (i-1)/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Heap is a special tree-based data structure. A binary tree is said to follow a heap data structure if:\n",
    "# it is a complete binary tree\n",
    "# All nodes in the tree follow the property that they are greater than their children i.e. the largest element is at the root\n",
    "# and both its children and smaller than the root and so on. Such a heap is called a max-heap. \n",
    "# If instead, all nodes are smaller than their children, it is called a min-heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to \"heapify\" a tree\n",
    "# Starting from a complete binary tree, we can modify it to become a Max-Heap by running a function called heapify on all\n",
    "# the non-leaf elements of the heap. Since heapify uses recursion, it can be difficult to grasp.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Working of Heap Sort\n",
    "# Since the tree satisfies Max-Heap property, then the largest item is stored at the root node.\n",
    "# Swap: Remove the root element and put at the end of the array (nth position) Put the last item of the tree (heap)\n",
    "# at the vacant place.\n",
    "# Remove: Reduce the size of the heap by 1.\n",
    "# Heapify: Heapify the root element again so that we have the highest element at root.\n",
    "# The process is repeated until all the items of the list are sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advantages of heapsort –\n",
    "#Efficiency –  The time required to perform Heap sort increases logarithmically while other algorithms may grow \n",
    "# exponentially slower as the number of items to sort increases. This sorting algorithm is very efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Memory Usage – Memory usage is minimal because apart from what is necessary to hold the initial list of items to be sorted,\n",
    "# it needs no additional memory space to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Simplicity –  It is simpler to understand than other equally efficient sorting algorithms because it does not use\n",
    "# advanced computer science concepts such as recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Systems concerned with security and embedded systems such as Linux Kernel use Heap Sort because of the O(n log n)\n",
    "# upper bound on Heapsort's running time and constant O(1) upper bound on its auxiliary storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#In the worst case scenario, we will need to move an element from the root to the leaf node making a multiple of \n",
    "# log(n) comparisons and swaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "# During the build_max_heap stage, we do that for n/2 elements so the worst case complexity of the build_heap step \n",
    "# is n/2*log n ~ nlog n.\n",
    "\n",
    "# During the sorting step, we exchange the root element with the last element and heapify the root element.\n",
    "# For each element, this again takes log n worst time because we might have to bring the element all the way from \n",
    "# the root to the leaf. Since we repeat this n times, the heap_sort step is also nlog n.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Also since the build_max_heap and heap_sort steps are executed one after another, the algorithmic complexity is\n",
    "# not multiplied and it remains in the order of nlog n.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Also it performs sorting in O(1) space complexity. Compared with Quick Sort, it has a better worst case ( O(nlog n) ).\n",
    "# Quick Sort has complexity O(n^2) for worst case. But in other cases, Quick Sort is fast. Introsort is an alternative to\n",
    "# heapsort that combines quicksort and heapsort to retain advantages of both: worst case speed of heapsort and average \n",
    "# speed of quicksort.\n",
