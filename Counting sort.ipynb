    "# Counting sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts the elements of an array in linear time by counting the number of occurrences \n",

    "# Counting sort uses the partial hashing technique to count the occurrence of the element in O(1).\n",
    "# The most important feature of working with counting sort is that it works with negative elements also. \n",
    "# It uses the subroutine to another sorting algorithm. The counting sort is not a comparison-based sorting algorithm and\n",
    "# its time complexity is O(n) with space proportional to the range of elements. \n",
