    "# Dijkstra‘s Algorithm was created in 1959 by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra.Dijkstra‘s\n",
    "# Algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a\n",
    "# graph with nonnegative edge path costs, producing a shortest path tree. This algorithm is often\n",
    "# used in routing and other network related protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "# While traversing the shortest path between two nodes, it is not necessary that every node will be visited.\n",
    "# Dijkstra’s Algorithm finds use in various real-life applications:\n",
    "# Digital Mapping Services\n",
    "# Social Networking Applications\n",
    "# Telephone Network\n",
    "# IP Routing to find the shortest path\n",
    "# • Traffic information systems use Dijkstra‘s algorithm in order to track the source and destinations from a given \n",
    "# particular source and destination\n",
    "# • In the Link-state routing protocol approach, using Dijkstra‘s algorithm each router calculates\n",
    "# the shortest path to each network and enters this information into the route table.\n",
    "# • OSPF- Open Shortest Path First, used in Internet routing. It uses a link-state in the individual areas that make up \n",
    "# the hierarchy. The computation is based on Dijkstra‘s algorithm which \n",
    "# is used to calculate the shortest path tree inside each area of the network.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Dijkstra’s algorithm is based on the following steps:\n",
    "# We will receive a weighted graph and an initial node.\n",
    "# Start with the initial node. Check the adjacent nodes.\n",
    "# Find the node with the minimum edge value.\n",
    "# Repeat this process until the destination node is visited.\n",
    "# At the end of the function, we return the shortest path weight for each node and the path as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# ADVANTAGES OF DIJKSTRA‘S ALGORITHM\n",
    "# • Once it has been carried out you can find the least weight path to all permanently labelled nodes.\n",
    "# • You don’t need a new diagram for each pass.\n",
    "# • Dijkstra’s algorithm has an order of n2 so it is efficient enough to use for relatively large problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "# DISADVANTAGES OF DIJKSTRA‘S ALGORITHM\n",
    "# • The major disadvantage of the algorithm is the fact that it does a blind search there by\n",
    "#consuming a lot of time waste of necessary resources.\n",
    "# • Another disadvantage is that it cannot handle negative edges. This leads to acyclic graphs and most often\n",
    "# cannot obtain the right shortest path."
